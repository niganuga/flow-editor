## Immediate Action Items

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)
```bash
./INSTALL_TESTS.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest @vitest/ui @vitest/coverage-v8 \
  @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom happy-dom
```

### Step 2: Run Initial Tests (2 minutes)
```bash
npm test
```

## Conclusion

This AI Photo Editor has **ZERO test coverage** despite being a production-grade application with complex image processing and AI integration. This represents a **critical quality assurance gap**.

The good news: A complete testing infrastructure is now ready to deploy. Initial tests are written. A comprehensive roadmap is provided. All you need to do is:

1. Run the installation script
2. Follow the Phase 1 roadmap
3. Achieve 80% coverage in 12 weeks

**The foundation is laid. Now it's time to build.**
