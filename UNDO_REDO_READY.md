## 🔧 Technical Details

### History Entry Structure
```typescript
interface HistoryEntry {
  imageUrl: string        // Blob URL to image
  imageFile: File         // File object
  fileName: string        // Filename
  description: string     // Human-readable description
  timestamp: number       // When state was created
}
```

### State Management
```typescript
// Current state
history: HistoryEntry[]    // Array of all states
historyIndex: number       // Current position (0-based)
maxHistorySize: 20         // Maximum states to keep

// Actions
undo()                     // Go back one state
redo()                     // Go forward one state
canUndo() → boolean        // Check if undo available
canRedo() → boolean        // Check if redo available
addToHistory(desc)         // Add current state with description
```

## ⚙️ Features

### ✅ Automatic Tracking
Every time you:
- Use AI Chat to edit
- Use Background Remover panel
- Use Upscaler panel
- Use Color Knockout panel
- Upload a new image

→ A new history entry is created

### ✅ Smart Memory Management
- Keeps last 20 states
- Older states automatically removed
- No memory leaks (blob URLs cleaned up)
- History cleared when image cleared

### ✅ Branch Management
If you:
1. Undo to state 3 (of 5)
2. Make a new edit
3. History becomes: 1→2→3→new (states 4-5 discarded)

This prevents "orphaned" history branches.

### ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts
- Work globally (anywhere on page)
- Disabled when typing in inputs
- Standard shortcuts (familiar to users)
- Cross-platform (Ctrl for Windows/Linux, Cmd for Mac)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Buttons don't appear
**Cause:** No image loaded
**Fix:** Upload an image first

### Issue: Buttons are disabled
**Cause:** No history available
**Fix:** Make an edit first (undo needs previous state)

### Issue: Keyboard shortcuts don't work
**Check:** Browser console for errors
**Check:** Are you typing in an input field?

### Issue: History shows 0/0
**Cause:** No history entries yet
**Fix:** Normal for first image upload

   - Don't have to undo one-by-one

3. **Keyboard shortcuts:**
   - Faster than clicking buttons
   - Ctrl+Z multiple times to step back
   - Ctrl+Y to step forward

4. **Experiment freely:**
   - Try different edits
   - Undo if you don't like it
   - Explore different editing paths
